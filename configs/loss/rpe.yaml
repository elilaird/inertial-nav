# Relative Pose Error (RPE) Loss Configuration

type: "RPELoss"

# Loss function
criterion: "mse" # Mean Squared Error
reduction: "sum"

# RPE sampling parameters
sampling:
    # Sample at 1 Hz (every 10 frames at 100 Hz sampling rate)
    downsample_rate: 10

    # Step size for RPE computation (in downsampled frames)
    step_size: 10 # Every second

    # Distance windows for RPE (in meters)
    distance_windows: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800]

# Loss validation
max_loss: 20.0 # Skip batch if loss exceeds this threshold

# Normalization
normalize: true # Normalize by number of samples
